List of resources used,                Cost,                                Usefulness:
- Jeremy's IT Lab (YouTube course),     FREE,                                   9/10 highly useful, sometimes too much information given about particular topics that aren't as major in the exam   
- Jeremy's IT Mega Lab for CCNA,        FREE,                                 10/10 extremely useful ,particularly parts relating to the exam topics, use as revision
- Jeremy's IT Lab practice exams,       PAID - CHEAP,                         6/10 useful but was quite different to Boson exams and some questions were very difficult beyond the level of the exam
- Boson ExSim Practice Exams + Labs,    PAID - NOT CHEAP,                     9/10 highly useful for preparing for the exam and simulating test conditions
- 31 Days before your CCNA,             PAID/FREE VERSIONS ONLINE,            9/10 highly useful in summarising key points and reinforcing areas of weakness
- CBT Nuggets CCNA Course,              PAID/FREE TRIAL,                      7/10 useful in covering basic concepts for those who are building their foundational knowledge and udnerstanding of                                                                                 concepts.
